## Validation

### HTML

- The W3C Markup Validator checks the markup validity of websites to see if there is any error in the coding of the website. It is a crucial tool to use to know if the site is completely validated with no errors.
- HTML on every page was checked alongside the CSS of the site. 

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| index.html | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmahidacodetrained.github.io%2Fproject1-toriigate%2Findex.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/w3cindexhtml.png) | Passed all checks |

## Browser Compatibility

- To make sure that the site is looking good we have to look at how the site is displayed on different browser engines. 
- We will look at Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

| Engine | Screenshot | Comments |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/chromebrowsertest.png) ![screenshot](documentation/testing/chromebrowsertest3.png) | Looks Good on Chrome |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/firefoxbrowsertest.png) ![screenshot](documentation/testing/firefoxbrowsertest2.png) | Looks Good on Firefox |
| Microsoft Edge | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/microsoftedgebrowser.png) ![screenshot](documentation/testing/microsoftedgebrowser2.png) | Looks Good on Edge |

## Responsiveness

- "Torii Gates" looks great everywhere. It is fully responsive on small mobile phones, medium mobile phones, tablets and the browser window.
- Media Queries were set up in the CSS code to ensure full responsiveness of the site.
- Media Queries allowed me to target certain elements and change the shape of them or classes and id's to make them bigger, smaller in their measurments to get a good responsive page.
- CSS Flexbox was also used to achieve this.

- To check the responsiveness of the website you can follow these steps:
1. Go to the [live site](https://mahidacodetrained.github.io/project1-toriigate/) and right cick with your mouse on the screen.
2. Once you have right clicked you will see a menu. Find Inspect Element.
3. Once you have found inspect element you will see responsive design on the top of the page.
4. This is where you can now scroll and drag the site to see how it looks like on different screen sizes.
