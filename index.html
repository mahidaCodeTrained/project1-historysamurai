                    <h4>What are Torii Gates?</h4>

                    <p>The <em>torii gates</em> of Japan are a traditional gate which is heavily symbolic to the
                        Japanese population.
                        The gates pave the way towards accessing a new spiritual dimension as the gates act as the entry
                        point towards many shrines in Japan.

                        However, torii gates aren't always located as an entry point to shrines. The mysterious nature
                        of the gates is brought about due to the various different locations they are identified in.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some notable areas where torii gates are found in Japan are:</p>
                    <ul id="torii-area-list">
                        <li>Lakes</li>
                        <li>Forests</li>
                        <li>Mountaintops</li>
                        <li>Ocean Coasts</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These locations as serene as they are serve a symbolic purpose as to why torii gates have been
                        created there.
                        Torii gates that are found in nature like the locations listed above are said to embody deities
                        and spiritual figures that are said to exist within
                        that nature. Thus the purpose of the torii is to transcend the mortal plain and enter the
                        spiritual dimension which hosts the <em>kami</em> (the god and deity of Japanese shintoism).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Although some people credit the origin of torii gates as having been derived from other parts of
                        the world... many in Japan believe that the origin of torii gates
                        is supported through a mythological text called <em>Kojiki (古事記)</em>. In this story the goddess
                        of the sun in Shintoism (Amaterasu Omikami) hid within a cave
                        whilst another 8 million deities tried to grab her attention. In doing so they created a tree
                        for the birds to chirp and rest, in this mythology this tree later became the first torii gate
                        which is fascinating as (tori-iru) means bird perch
                        giving a good amount of credibility to this mythology.

                    <h4>The Role of Shintoism</h4>

                    <p><em>Shintoism</em> is actively the biggest practiced religion/belief in all of Japan which is
                        perhaps why
                        torii gates are such an icon of the country.
                        It is said that there are atleast 90,000 shinto shrines across all of Japan with every single
                        one having atleast one torii gate marking it's entrance. The Japanese public therefore, hold the
                        torii gates at a very high regard and respect.
                        In addition, it is customary to bow before the gates paying homage to the "kami" that overlooks
                        the torii.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Although some tourists enter torii gates right through their center which in shintoism, is
                        travelling through a sacred portal to the dimension of the kami... Although many
                        tend to walk along the edges of the gate to not distrub the gods (kami). It's in popular belief
                        in shintoism that you must exit from the same torii gate that you walked into to access the
                        mundane plain again. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Throughout the year, millions within Japan flock out to pay respect to shinto shrines across the
                        country to celebrate special events
                        such as the new year and cultural events such as <em>Setsubun</em> which is a Japanese festival
                        honored to casting out evil spirits.
                        This festival is relative to the appearance of torii gates in their colors across Japan,
                        as many gates are coloured in vermillion
                        due to belief that is casts away evil spirits and preserves the torii gate acting as
                        protection for the human world.</p>

                    <h4>The Structure of the Torii</h4>
                    <p>There are believed to be around 60 different types of torii gates in Japan, all 60 types having
                        variations from one another.
                        These variations often come within their structure, color and sizes. There are two popular
                        designs of the torii which are <em>Shinmei and Myojin type torii's</em></p>
