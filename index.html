                    <h4>What are Torii Gates?</h4>

                    <p>The <em>torii gates</em> of Japan are a traditional gate which is heavily symbolic to the
                        Japanese population.
                        The gates pave the way towards accessing a new spiritual dimension as the gates act as the entry
                        point towards many shrines in Japan.

                        However, torii gates aren't always located as an entry point to shrines. The mysterious nature
                        of the gates is brought about due to the various different locations they are identified in.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some notable areas where torii gates are found in Japan are:</p>
                    <ul id="torii-area-list">
                        <li>Lakes</li>
                        <li>Forests</li>
                        <li>Mountaintops</li>
                        <li>Ocean Coasts</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These locations as serene as they are serve a symbolic purpose as to why torii gates have been
                        created there.
                        Torii gates that are found in nature like the locations listed above are said to embody deities
                        and spiritual figures that are said to exist within
                        that nature. Thus the purpose of the torii is to transcend the mortal plain and enter the
                        spiritual dimension which hosts the <em>kami</em> (the god and deity of Japanese shintoism).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Although some people credit the origin of torii gates as having been derived from other parts of
                        the world... many in Japan believe that the origin of torii gates
                        is supported through a mythological text called <em>Kojiki (古事記)</em>. In this story the goddess
                        of the sun in Shintoism (Amaterasu Omikami) hid within a cave
                        whilst another 8 million deities tried to grab her attention. In doing so they created a tree
                        for the birds to chirp and rest, in this mythology this tree later became the first torii gate which is fascinating as (tori-iru) means bird perch
                        giving a good amount of credibility to this mythology.
