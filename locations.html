                    <p>Fushimi Inari Shrine is one of, if not the most famous shinto shrine in all of Japan, it is known
                        for it's trail of plentiful torii gates wrapped around a beautiful vermillion color. The shrine
                        is dedicated to Inari <em>(the shinto god of rice)</em></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Foxes are said to be messengers of the god Inari therefore around the shrine are many statues
                        paying homage to the fox.
                        It is also quite symbolic that the colors of the torii in Fushimi Inari Shrine are all
                        vermillion with black engravings akin to the color of a foxes pelt.

                    <p>The Senbon Torii Trail at Fushimi Inari Shrine leading to the shrine and the peak of Mount Inari
                        is a trail of a thousand... yes a thousand torii gates although, across the entire
                        mountain/shrine there are believed to be over 10,000 torii gates in all sizes near the shrines.
                        These torii gates are among the most visited in all of Japan for it's sheer beauty and sense of
                        spirtituality from it's colors and it's location enveloped in peace and nature.

                        alt="An image of Meiji Shrine in Tokyo on a rainy day.">
                    <p>Tokyo is home to one of the most towering and jaw-dropping torii gates
                        at the Meiji Jingu.
                        The torii that is located at the entrance of the Meiji Shrine was constructed to honor the late
                        Emperor Meiji.
                        Meiji Shrine annualy is a popular location for tourists and countryfolk during the new year
                        amounting to 3 million visitors per year.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The torii is surrounded by a forest and has grown to adapt to it's surroundings by taking on a
                        mossy green color for the "kasagi" (top piece of the torii) making for a breathtaking image for
                        tourists around the world.</p>
                    <img src="assets/images/pexels-imustbedead-12086180.webp" id="meiji-torii"
                        alt="An image of the mossy green Meiji Torii.">

                    <p>An interesting fact about this torii is that it isn't the original!. The original torii gate
                        that marked the entrance to Meiji Shrine in 1920 was destroyed by lightning in 1966 so a new
                        gate was built in 1975 which is this ever so famous
                        torii standing tall at 12 meters of height and over 17 meters in width making it the largest
                        wooden torii on the planet!</p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="poem"><em>As people move and the forest shakes with the wind, the torii remains still
                            taking in the
                            beauty of nature...</em></p>

                    <p>Miyajima is a very old and traditional shrine in Japan, with the name directly translating to
                        "shrine island". It's towering torii gate lies as the main tourist attraction at the shrine.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The beautiful gate stands still against the crashing and ever moving tides in Hiroshima Bay.
                        The torii gate during the high tide almost looks as if it's floating making for a gorgeous
                        memory which welcomes millions of tourists to return to this beautiful spot. The "shrine island"
                        Miyajima is known across Japan for it's long history and strong connection as a unique sight of
                        shintoism.
