# Torii Gates

This project is designed to transport you to Japan to learn and wonder at the torii gates that rule over Japan giving spirituality,
 emotion and a sense of mystical resonance. The project 'Torii Gates' contains three pages with two being highly informative. Although the two pages are highly informative they set the tone and offer users a chance to wonder and gaze at images of the torii gates that this project is concerned with.

 As stated this project has three pages consisting of :
 - index.html / **primarily an informative page concerned with educating users to the history, facts and mystery of the gates**
 - locations.html / **dedicated to showcasing the select most famous torii's in Japan with a heavier emphasis on showing the user with the use of images**
 - gallery.html / **As you may have guessed, a gallery page to fully transport the user to Japan with a look on highly detailed images of torii's**
